## 3. Quantitative Assessment

### Valuation Methodology

We utilized two approaches to estimate fair value:

1. **Income Approach** - Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)
   - Projection period: 5 years (2026-2030)
   - Terminal growth rate: 3.0%
   - WACC: Sub B 9.5%, Sub C 12.0%

2. **Market Approach** - Guideline Public Company Method
   - Comparable companies analyzed
   - Enterprise Value / Revenue multiples
   - Enterprise Value / EBITDA multiples

### Sub B - EU Distribution

**DCF Analysis:**
| Year | Revenue | EBITDA | Free Cash Flow | Present Value |
|------|---------|--------|----------------|---------------|
| 2026 | €215M | €28M | €18M | €16.4M |
| 2027 | €232M | €31M | €21M | €17.5M |
| 2028 | €250M | €34M | €24M | €18.3M |
| 2029 | €270M | €38M | €27M | €18.8M |
| 2030 | €292M | €42M | €31M | €19.7M |
| Terminal Value | | | | €135.0M |
| **Total Enterprise Value** | | | | **€225.7M ($185M USD)** |

**Market Approach:**
- EV/Revenue: 0.85x (comparable median: 0.80x)
- EV/EBITDA: 7.2x (comparable median: 7.0x)
- Implied Fair Value: $178M - $192M

**Conclusion:** Fair Value of $185M exceeds Carrying Value of $125.7M by **47%**. No impairment.

### Sub C - APAC SaaS

**DCF Analysis:**
| Year | ARR | EBITDA | Free Cash Flow | Present Value |
|------|-----|--------|----------------|---------------|
| 2026 | $148M | $22M | $15M | $13.4M |
| 2027 | $178M | $32M | $24M | $19.1M |
| 2028 | $213M | $45M | $36M | $25.6M |
| 2029 | $256M | $62M | $52M | $33.1M |
| 2030 | $307M | $85M | $72M | $40.9M |
| Terminal Value | | | | €122.0M |
| **Total Enterprise Value** | | | | **$254.1M** |

**Market Approach:**
- EV/ARR: 5.2x (SaaS median: 5.5x)
- EV/Recurring Revenue: 4.8x
- Rule of 40: Score of 38 (Revenue Growth + EBITDA Margin)
- Implied Fair Value: $155M - $175M

**Conclusion:** Fair Value of $165M (weighted avg) exceeds Carrying Value of $94.5M by **75%**. No impairment.
