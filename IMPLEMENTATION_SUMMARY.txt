- POST / - Create workpaper
- PATCH /:id - Update workpaper
- DELETE /:id - Delete workpaper
- POST /:id/attachments - Upload attachment
- POST /:id/signoff - Sign off

ANALYTICAL SERVICE (/api/analytical)
- POST /ratios/:id - Calculate ratios
- GET /trends/:id - Get trends
- GET /variance/:id - Get variance
- GET /benchmarks/:industry - Industry benchmarks
- GET /ai-insights/:id - AI insights
- POST /run/:id - Run analysis

TESTING SERVICE (/api/testing)
