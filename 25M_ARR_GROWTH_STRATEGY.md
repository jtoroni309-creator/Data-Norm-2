| **"AI makes mistakes"** | "You're right to be cautious. That's why we built AI explainability. You can see exactly why AI made each decision. You're always in control." | "Our AI has 97% accuracy on risk detection, vs 82% for manual processes" |

- AEs: Up to 10% discount
- Enterprise AEs: Up to 20% discount
- VP Sales: Up to 30% discount
- CRO: Up to 40% discount (requires exec approval)

**Common Negotiation Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: "Can you do better on price?"**
- Response: "I understand budget is important. Can I ask: If price wasn't an issue, would you move forward today?"
- If yes: "Great! Let me see what I can do. If I can get you [10% discount], can you sign this week?"
- Trade: Discount for annual prepayment, case study, reference, logo usage

**Scenario 2: "Competitor is cheaper"**

**Scenario 3: "We need monthly payments"**
- Response: "I understand cash flow is important. Our annual prepayment saves you 20%. But if monthly works better, we can do that."
- "Monthly is $[X], annual prepaid is $[Y] - saves you $[Z] over the year."
- "What makes sense for your firm?"

**Scenario 4: "We want a longer trial"**
- Response: "I understand wanting to be thorough. Our 14-day trial is designed to complete 2-3 engagements, which gives you a real sense of the ROI."

## PART 9: RISK MITIGATION & CONTINGENCY PLANS

### 9.1 Key Risks

**Risk Matrix:**

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Product not production-ready** | Medium | Critical | Fixed - deployment audit complete, 24 services need deployment |
| **Sales team ramp too slow** | Medium | High | Hire experienced AEs, provide intensive training, clear comp plan |
| **Competition responds aggressively** | Medium | Medium | Differentiate with E&O integration, move fast, patent AI features |
| **Market adoption slower than projected** | Low | High | Pilot programs, case studies, money-back guarantee |
| **E&O insurance partnerships fail** | Low | High | Direct CPA firm sales still viable, insurance savings validated internally |
| **Key integrations delayed** | Medium | High | Prioritize QuickBooks (covers 80%), outsource integration development |
| **Regulatory concerns about AI** | Low | Medium | AI explainability, human oversight required, AICPA guidance compliance |
| **Team execution issues** | Low | High | Hire A-players, clear OKRs, weekly metrics reviews |

### 9.2 Contingency Plans

- Increase marketing budget 50% (shift from profit to growth)
- Add 5 more AEs immediately
- Launch aggressive discount promotion (20% off first year)

**If Product Quality Issues Emerge:**
- Hire 10 more engineers immediately
- Implement 24/7 on-call support
- Pause new customer acquisition (fix quality first)

- Publish transparent incident reports

**If Major Competitor Launches Similar AI Features:**
- Accelerate AI roadmap (invest more in R&D)
- Patent unique features (intelligent sampling algorithm, E&O integration)
- Focus on superior customer experience
- Aggressive pricing (temporary)
- Lock in customers with multi-year contracts (discounts)

**If E&O Insurance Partnerships Fall Through:**
- Pivot messaging to time savings + quality (ROI still strong)
- Build internal E&O risk scoring tool (self-service)
- Partner with independent insurance brokers instead of carriers
- Develop case studies showing actual claims prevented

**If Hiring Targets Missed:**
- Use fractional executives (VP Sales, CRO on contract)
- Partner with sales development agencies (outsourced SDRs)
- Offer equity compensation (increase offer attractiveness)
- Hire remote (expand talent pool)
- Promote from within (faster ramp)

### 9.3 Success Indicators & KPIs
