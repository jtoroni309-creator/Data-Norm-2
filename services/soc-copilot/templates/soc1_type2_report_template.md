**REPORT OF INDEPENDENT SERVICE AUDITOR ON CONTROLS AT A SERVICE ORGANIZATION RELEVANT TO USER ENTITIES' INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING**

---

## SECTION I: INDEPENDENT SERVICE AUDITOR'S REPORT

### To Management of {{CLIENT_NAME}}:

#### Scope
We have examined {{CLIENT_NAME}}'s (the "Service Organization") description of its {{SERVICE_DESCRIPTION}} (the "System") throughout the period {{REVIEW_PERIOD_START}} to {{REVIEW_PERIOD_END}} (the "Review Period") and the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of controls stated in the description to achieve the control objectives stated in the description, based on the criteria identified in {{CLIENT_NAME}}'s assertion.

#### Service Organization's Responsibilities
{{CLIENT_NAME}} is responsible for:

1. **Preparing the description and assertion**, including the completeness, accuracy, and method of presentation of the description and assertion
2. **Providing the services covered by the description**
3. **Stating the control objectives** and identifying the risks that threaten the achievement of those objectives
4. **Identifying and designing controls** to achieve the control objectives stated in the description
5. **Ensuring the controls were operating effectively** throughout the Review Period

#### Service Auditor's Responsibilities
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Service Organization's description and on the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of the controls to achieve the related control objectives stated in the description, based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). Those standards require that we plan and perform our examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether, in all material respects:

1. The description is presented in accordance with the description criteria in AT-C Section 320, Reporting on an Examination of Controls at a Service Organization Relevant to User Entities' Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
2. The controls stated in the description were suitably designed throughout the Review Period to provide reasonable assurance that the control objectives stated in the description would be achieved if the controls operated effectively and user entities applied the complementary user entity controls (CUECs) stated in the description
3. The controls operated effectively throughout the Review Period to provide reasonable assurance that the control objectives stated in the description were achieved, if complementary user entity controls stated in the description operated effectively throughout the period

Our examination included:
- Obtaining an understanding of the Service Organization's system and control environment
- Assessing the risks that the control objectives stated in the description were not achieved
- Performing procedures to obtain evidence about whether the controls stated in the description were suitably designed
- Testing the operating effectiveness of those controls throughout the Review Period
- Evaluating the overall presentation of the description

We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

#### Inherent Limitations
Because of their nature, controls at a service organization may not prevent, or detect and correct, all errors or omissions in processing or reporting transactions. Also, the projection to the future of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls is subject to the risk that controls at a service organization may become inadequate or fail.

#### Opinion
In our opinion, in all material respects, based on the criteria described in {{CLIENT_NAME}}'s assertion:

a. The description fairly presents the {{SERVICE_DESCRIPTION}} that was designed and implemented throughout the period {{REVIEW_PERIOD_START}} to {{REVIEW_PERIOD_END}}.

b. The controls related to the control objectives stated in the description were suitably designed throughout the period {{REVIEW_PERIOD_START}} to {{REVIEW_PERIOD_END}} to provide reasonable assurance that the control objectives would be achieved if the controls operated effectively and if user entities applied the complementary user entity controls stated in the description.

c. The controls stated in the description operated effectively throughout the period {{REVIEW_PERIOD_START}} to {{REVIEW_PERIOD_END}} to provide reasonable assurance that the control objectives stated in the description were achieved, if complementary user entity controls stated in the description operated effectively throughout the period.

#### Restricted Use
This report, including the description of tests of controls and results thereof in Section IV, is intended solely for the information and use of {{CLIENT_NAME}}, user entities of {{CLIENT_NAME}}'s {{SERVICE_DESCRIPTION}} during some or all of the period {{REVIEW_PERIOD_START}} to {{REVIEW_PERIOD_END}}, and the independent auditors of such user entities who have a sufficient understanding to consider it, along with other information, including information about controls implemented by user entities themselves, when assessing the risks of material misstatements of user entities' financial statements. This report is not intended to be, and should not be, used by anyone other than these specified parties.

## SECTION II: {{CLIENT_NAME}}'S ASSERTION

### Management's Assertion of {{CLIENT_NAME}}

We are responsible for designing, implementing, operating, and maintaining effective controls within the {{SERVICE_DESCRIPTION}} (the "System") to provide reasonable assurance that the control objectives stated in the description were achieved.

We have prepared the attached description of the System during the period {{REVIEW_PERIOD_START}} to {{REVIEW_PERIOD_END}} (the "Review Period"). The description is intended to provide user entities and their auditors with information about the System that may be useful when assessing the risks of material misstatement in user entities' financial statements.

We confirm, to the best of our knowledge and belief, that:

a. The attached description fairly presents the System made available to user entities during the Review Period for processing their transactions. The criteria we used in making this assertion were that the description:
   1. Presents how the System was designed and implemented to process relevant transactions, including, if applicable:
      - The classes of transactions processed
      - The procedures within both automated and manual systems by which transactions are processed
      - The related accounting records, supporting information, and specific accounts that are used to initiate, authorize, record, process, and report transactions
      - How the System captures and addresses significant events and conditions, other than transactions
      - The process used to prepare reports or other information provided to user entities
      - Specified control objectives and controls designed to achieve those objectives
      - Complementary user entity controls stated in the description necessary, in combination with controls at the Service Organization, to achieve the control objectives
      - Other aspects of our control environment, risk assessment process, information and communication systems (including the related business processes), control activities, and monitoring controls that are relevant to processing and reporting user entities' transactions

   2. Does not omit or distort information relevant to the scope of the System being described, while acknowledging that the description is prepared to meet the common needs of a broad range of user entities and their auditors and may not include every aspect of the System that each user entity and its auditor may consider important in its particular environment

b. The controls related to the control objectives stated in the description were suitably designed throughout the period {{REVIEW_PERIOD_START}} to {{REVIEW_PERIOD_END}} to provide reasonable assurance that the stated control objectives were achieved if:
   - The controls operated effectively throughout the period
   - User entities applied the complementary user entity controls stated in the description throughout the period

c. The controls stated in the description operated effectively throughout the period {{REVIEW_PERIOD_START}} to {{REVIEW_PERIOD_END}} to provide reasonable assurance that the control objectives stated in the description were achieved, if complementary user entity controls stated in the description operated effectively throughout the period.
