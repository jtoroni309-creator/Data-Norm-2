# SOC Copilot - Competitive Analysis & Differentiators

## Executive Summary

SOC Copilot is the **only auditor-first, AI-native SOC audit platform** on the market. While competitors focus on either helping companies get compliant (Drata, Vanta) or providing general audit tools (AuditBoard, CaseWare), we've built the first platform specifically designed for CPA firms to **perform SOC 1 and SOC 2 audits** with integrated AI and security testing capabilities.
