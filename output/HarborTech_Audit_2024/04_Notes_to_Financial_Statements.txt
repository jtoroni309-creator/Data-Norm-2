internationally.


Basis of Presentation

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).


Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.


Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised
goods or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the
consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods
or services.


Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less.


Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from
outstanding balances. Management provides for probable uncollectible amounts
through a charge to earnings and a credit to an allowance for doubtful accounts
based on its assessment of the current status of individual accounts.


Inventory

Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is
determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.


Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 40 years. Maintenance and
