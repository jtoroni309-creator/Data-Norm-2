This representation letter is provided in connection with your audit of the
financial statements of HarborTech Manufacturing, Inc., which comprise the
balance sheet as of December 31, 2024, and the related statements of income,
stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related
notes to the financial statements, for the purpose of expressing an opinion
as to whether the financial statements are presented fairly, in all material
respects, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (U.S. GAAP).

Certain representations in this letter are described as being limited to
matters that are material. Items are considered material, regardless of size,
if they involve an omission or misstatement of accounting information that, in
light of surrounding circumstances, makes it probable that the judgment of a
reasonable person relying on the information would be changed or influenced by
the omission or misstatement. An omission or misstatement that is monetarily
small in amount could be considered material as a result of qualitative factors.

We confirm, to the best of our knowledge and belief, as of the date of this
letter, the following representations made to you during your audit:

    audit engagement letter, including our responsibility for the preparation

    conformity with U.S. GAAP and include all properly classified funds and
    other financial information required by generally accepted accounting
    principles.

    maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair
    presentation of financial statements that are free from material
    misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

  * We acknowledge our responsibility for the design, implementation, and
    maintenance of internal control to prevent and detect fraud.

    those measured at fair value, are reasonable.

    that is relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the financial
    statements, such as records, documentation, and other matters.

    are reflected in the financial statements.

  * We have disclosed to you the results of our assessment of the risk that the

    control, or others where the fraud could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

    the entity's financial statements communicated by employees, former employees,

  * We have disclosed to you all known instances of noncompliance or suspected
    noncompliance with laws and regulations whose effects should be considered
    when preparing financial statements.

  * We have disclosed to you all known actual or possible litigation and claims
    whose effects should be considered when preparing the financial statements.

    noncompliance with, or deficiencies in, financial reporting practices.
